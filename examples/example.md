# Temporal Difference Learning: Understanding the Basics

In this episode of Code Emporium, we will delve into the concept of temporal difference learning, a crucial aspect of reinforcement learning. Let's break it down step by step to understand its significance.

## What is Temporal Difference Learning?

At its core, temporal difference learning is a method used by value-based reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, to iteratively learn state value functions or state-action value functions.

## Understanding Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Before we dive deeper into temporal difference learning, let's quickly recap the three main paradigms of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: In this paradigm, we use labeled data to train a model that can map inputs to corresponding outputs. It is commonly used for classification and regression problems.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: This paradigm focuses on identifying patterns within unlabeled data. Tasks such as dimensionality reduction and clustering fall under this category.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning deals with learning how to make decisions to maximize a numerical reward signal. It involves mapping situations to actions that yield the highest rewards. Algorithms that follow this approach are known as reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Value-based vs. Policy-based Methods

Reinforcement learning algorithms can be further categorized into two types: value-based methods and policy-based methods.

- **Value-based Methods**: These methods aim to determine a value function, which quantifies the total reward. By using this value function, an optimal policy can be determined. Q-learning is an example of a value-based method.

- **Policy-based Methods**: Unlike value-based methods, policy-based methods directly determine the optimal policy without using a value function. The optimal policy is the one that maximizes the total reward. Proximal Policy Optimization is an example of a policy-based method.

## State Value Functions and State-Action Value Functions

To understand temporal difference learning fully, we need to grasp the concepts of state value functions and state-action value functions.

- **State Value Functions**: State value functions take a state as input and output a real number. They quantify how good it is to be in a specific state.

- **State-Action Value Functions**: State-action value functions take both a state and an action as inputs and output a real number known as the Q value. Q values quantify how good it is to be in a specific state and take a specific action in that state.

## The Process of Temporal Difference Learning

To illustrate the process of temporal difference learning, let's consider a fully observable grid world with nine squares. The goal for the agent is to reach the +10 reward spot while avoiding the -10 poison square. The other squares have a reward of -1.

1. The agent starts by storing the value of each state in a table, initializing them to zero.

2. The agent follows an exploration policy, randomly choosing actions in each state.

3. The agent takes an action, observes the reward, and transitions to a new state.

4. Using the Bellman equation, the agent updates the value of the previous state based on the observed reward and the value of the new state.

5. The temporal difference error is calculated as the difference between the observed and expected values of the state.

6. The value of the state is updated in the table using a learning rate (alpha) to control the pace of learning.

7. This process is repeated for multiple time steps until the agent reaches the goal, completing one episode.

8. Multiple episodes are performed, continually updating the table values until they stabilize. At this point, the value functions are considered learned.

9. With the learned value functions, the agent can make informed decisions based on the optimal policy derived from these values.

## Conclusion

In summary, temporal difference learning is a method used by value-based reinforcement learning algorithms to iteratively learn state value functions or state-action value functions. By updating the values based on observed rewards, the agent gradually improves its decision-making abilities. Understanding temporal difference learning is crucial for comprehending reinforcement learning as a whole.
